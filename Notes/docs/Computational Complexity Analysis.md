##  Complexity Analysis

- Computational complexity analysis is a theoretical assessment that measures the computational resources required by an algorithm to solve a computational problem.
- It provides a quantitative understanding of the speed and spacing requirements of the operations, enabling informed decisions when writing code.

### Key Concepts

- **Time Complexity**: Measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, typically expressed as a function of the input size (n).
- **Space Complexity**: Measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires, also expressed as a function of the input size (n).
- **Big-O Notation**: A shorthand way to describe the upper bound of an algorithmâ€™s time or space complexity, often used to classify algorithms into categories (e.g., O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), etc.).

#### Big-O Notation

- Big-O notation gives an upper bound of the complexity in the worst case, helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes arbitrarily large.
- The size of input is represented by 'n'.
